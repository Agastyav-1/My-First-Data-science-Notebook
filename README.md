# Data Science Learning Journey

## Introduction
My journey into **Data Science** began during my final semester of undergraduate studies in **Mechanical Engineering**. While my background was in core engineering concepts, I was always intrigued by **data-driven decision-making and automation**. 

During this time, I was introduced to **data science fundamentals** through an elective course, where I worked on my first-ever **Jupyter Notebook exercise**‚Äîthe **"Data Science Ecosystem"**. This exercise sparked my curiosity about how data can be processed, analyzed, and leveraged for insights. This initial exposure to programming and analytics inspired me to transition from **mechanical engineering to data science**, leading me to pursue a **career in data analytics and machine learning**.

## Key Learnings
